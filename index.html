    <h4><right> Regarding Miss Marcéy - </h4> 
    <p><right> 
      From the limited information we’ve obtained, we find Miss Aline Marcéy to be a very pressing <br> 
      matter. Though she seems to be a new threat, she’s been causing chaos for quite some time <br> 
      under the alias Liane Céymar. She’s been spotted at several crime scenes but the FBI has yet <br> 
      to catch her. We’ve found Marcéy guilty of several murders from the past, all of which, have <br> 
      been under the orders of someone else. Based on this, we can assume her “profession” is <br> 
      assassination. After talking with some of her past “clients” we’ve discovered that she has been <br> 
      running this sort of business for nearly ten years without the government's knowledge, it’s also <br> 
      been discovered that she’s paid quite a large sum of money in return. in fact her current salary <br> 
      is about three times larger than high ranking congressmen or other political figures of our nation. <br> 
      Despite her major felonies that could easily qualify her for the death sentence the Government <br> 
      has chosen to drop these charges, with ONE CONDITION: from here on out, Marcéy will work <br> 
      for and only for the government, carrying out whichever given task she is assigned, regardless <br> 
      of what that assignment may be. Failure to comply will result in her immediate execution. We <br> 
      believe having Marcéy on our side will prove to be a very useful asset. <br>   
    </right></p> 
  </body> 
  
  
  <body> 
    <p> However, we acknowledge that there are many problems in this proposal… </p> 
   
    <ul> 
      <li> We are unaware of Marcéy’s current whereabouts or general location.</li> 
      <li>There’s no telling whether or not she will comply to our agreements. </li> 
      <li>It’s possible she may take our offer with ulterior motives in mind.</li> 
   
    </ul> 
    <p>To solve this problem we have chosen to send out our chosen agents in the hopes of locating Marcéy, the plan goes as follows: </p>
     
    <ol> 
      <li> Using the given information, track down her main clientele with the hope of finding where her next hit will be.</li> 
      <li> After confirming  where and when her next hit will be, send out secret agents to secure target  </li> 
      <li> Once captured, bring Marcéy back to the base* where proposal will be introduced. </li> 
    </ol> 
    
    <p> *depending on where her next hit is, base location will be determined sometime in the future. </p> 
    
   <p> Mission details can be found <a href="http://www.perkley.com/"> here </a> along with the list of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_detectives">agents</a> on the mission </p>
   
   <p>All the information embedded in this document was acquired through Marcéy’s brief detainment in the mercelina city police department <br> 
     before her breakout. </p>
