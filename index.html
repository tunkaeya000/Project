    <h4><center> <u>Regarding Miss Marcéy -</u> </center></h4> 
    <p><center> 
      From the limited information we’ve obtained, we find Miss Aline Marcéy to be a very pressing <br> 
      matter. Though she seems to be a new threat, she’s been causing chaos for quite some time <br> 
      under the alias Liane Céymar. She’s been spotted at several crime scenes but the FBI has yet <br> 
      to catch her. We’ve found Marcéy guilty of several murders from the past, all of which, have <br> 
      been under the orders of someone else. Based on this, we can assume her “profession” is <br> 
      assassination. After talking with some of her past “clients” we’ve discovered that she has been <br> 
      running this sort of business for nearly ten years without the government's knowledge, it’s also <br> 
      been discovered that she’s paid quite a large sum of money in return. in fact her current salary <br> 
      is about three times larger than high ranking congressmen or other political figures of our nation. <br> 
      Despite her major felonies that could easily qualify her for the death sentence the Government <br> 
      has chosen to drop these charges, with ONE CONDITION: from here on out, Marcéy will work <br> 
      for and only for the government, carrying out whichever given task she is assigned, regardless <br> 
      of what that assignment may be. Failure to comply will result in her immediate execution. We <br> 
      believe having Marcéy on our side will prove to be a very useful asset. <br>   
    </center></p>

    <p> However, we acknowledge that there are many problems in this proposal…  </p> 
   
    <p> <ul> 
      <li> We are unaware of Marcéy’s current whereabouts or general location.</li> 
      <li>There’s no telling whether or not she will comply to our agreements. </li> 
      <li>It’s possible she may take our offer with ulterior motives in mind.</li> 
   
      </ul> </p>
  <p>  To solve this problem we have chosen to send out our chosen agents in the hopes of locating Marcéy, the plan goes as follows:  </p>
     
   <p> <ol> 
      <li> Using the given information, track down her main clientele with the hope of finding where her next hit will be.</li> 
      <li> After confirming  where and when her next hit will be, send out secret agents to secure target  </li> 
      <li> Once captured, bring Marcéy back to the base* where proposal will be introduced. </li> 
     </ol> </p>
    
     <p> <i>*depending on where her next hit is, base location will be determined sometime in the future.</i> </p>
